\chapter{Gathering Data with R}\label{DataGather}

How you gather your data directly impacts how reproducible your research will be. You should try your best to document every step of your data gathering process. Reproduction will be easier if your documentation--especially, variable descriptions and source code--makes it easy for you and others to understand what you have done. If all of your data gathering steps are tied together by your source code, then independent researchers (and you) can more easily regather the data. Regathering data will be easiest if running your code allows you to get all the way back to the raw data files--the rawer the better. Of course this may not always be possible. You may need to conduct interviews or compile information from paper based archives, for example. The best you can sometimes do is describe your data gathering process in detail. Nonetheless, R's automated data gathering capabilities for internet-based information is extensive. Learning how to take full advantage of these capabilities greatly increases reproducibility and can save you considerable time and effort over the long run.

In this chapter we'll learn how to gather quantitative data in a reproducible and, in some cases, fully replicable way. We'll start by learning how to use data gathering makefiles to organize your whole data gathering process so that it can be completely reproduced. Then we will learn the details of how to actually load data into R from various sources, both locally on your computer and remotely via the internet. In the next chapter (Chapter \ref{DataClean}) we'll learn the details of how to clean up raw data so that it can be merged together into data frames that you can use for statistical analyses.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% Organizing data gathering
\section{Organize Your Data Gathering: Makefiles}

Before getting into the details of using R to gather data, let's start by creating a plan to organize the process. Organizing your data gathering process from the beginning of a research project improves the possibility of reproducibility and can save you significant effort over the course of the project by making it easier to add and regather data later on. 

A key part of reproducible data gathering with R, like reproducible research in general, is segmenting the process into modular\index{modular files} files that can all be run by a common ``makefile''\index{makefile}. In this chapter we'll learn how to create make-like files run exclusively from R as well as GNU Make makefiles\index{GNU Make}\index{GNU},\footnote{GNU stands for ``GNU's Not Unix'', indicating that it is Unix-like.}\index{GNU Make} which you run from a shell.\footnote{To standardize things, I use the terms ``R make-like file'' for files created and run in R and the standard ``makefile'' for files run by Make.} Learning how to create R make-like files is fairly easy. Using GNU Make does require learning some more new syntax. However, it has one very clear advantage: it only runs a source code file that has been updated since the last time you ran the makefile. This is very useful if part of your data gathering process is very computationally and time intensive.

Segmenting your data gathering into modular files and tying them together with some sort of makefile allows you to more easily navigate research text and find errors in the source code. The makefile's output is the data set that you'll use in the statistical analyses. There are two types of source code files that the makefile runs: data gathering/clean up files and merging files. Data clean up files bring raw individual data sources into R and transform them so that they can be merged together with data from the other sources. Many of the R tools for data clean up and merging will be covered in Chapter \ref{DataClean}. In this chapter we mostly cover the ways to bring raw data into R. Merging files are executed by the makefile after it runs the data gathering/clean up files.

It's a good idea to have the source code files use very raw data as input. Your source code should avoid directly changing these raw data files. Instead changes should be put into new objects and data files. Doing this makes it easier to reconstruct the steps you took to create your data set. Also, while cleaning and merging your data you may transform it in unintended ways, for example, accidentally deleting some observations that you had wanted to keep. Having the raw data makes it easy to go back and correct your mistakes.

\subsection{R Make-like files}

When you create make-like files in R to organize and run your data gathering you usually only need one or two commands, {\tt{setwd}}\index{R command!setwd} and {\tt{source}}\index{R command!source}. As we talked about in Chapter \ref{DirectoriesChapter}, {\tt{setwd}} simply tells R where to look for and place files. {\tt{source}} tells R to run code in an R source code file.\footnote{We use the {\tt{source}} command more in the Chapter \ref{StatsModel}.}  Let's see what an R data make file might look like for our example project (see Figure \ref{ExampleTree}). The file paths in this example are for Unix-like systems and the make-like file is called \emph{Makefile.R}.

<<Ch6ExampleRMake, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE>>=

# Example R make-like file

# Gather and clean up raw data files.

source("GatherSource/Gather2.R") 
source("GatherSource/Gather3.R")
    
# Merge cleaned data frames into data frame object CleanedData
source("GatherSource/MergeData.R")
@

This code first sets the working directory. Then it runs three source code files to gather data from three different sources. These files gather the data and clean it so that it can be merged together. The cleaned data frames are available in the current workspace. Next the code runs the \emph{MergeData.R} file that merges the data frames and saves the output data frame as a CSV\index{CSV} formatted file. The CSV file could be the main file we use for statistical analysis. \emph{MergeData.R} also creates a Markdown file with a table describing the variables and their sources. We'll come back to how to create tables in Chapter \ref{TablesChapter}.

You can run the commands in this file one by one or run the make-like file by putting it through the \texttt{source} command so that it will run it all at once.

\subsection{GNU Make}

R make-like files are a simple way to tie together a segmented data gathering process. If one or more of the source files that our example before runs is computationally intensive it is a good idea to run them only when they are updated. However, this can become tedious, especially if there are many segments. The well established GNU Make\index{GNU Make} command line program\footnote{GNU Make was originally developed in 1977 by Stuart Feldman as a way to compile computer programs from a series of files, its primary use to this day. For an overview see: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)}. For installation instructions please see Section \ref{InstallMake}.} deals with this problem by comparing the output files' time stamps\footnote{A file's time stamp records the time and date when it was last changed.}\index{time stamp} to time stamps of the source files that created them. If a source file has a time stamp that is newer than its output, Make will run it. If the source's time stamp is older than its output, Make will skip it.

In Make terminology the output files are called ``targets''\index{Make!targets} and the files that create them are called ``prerequisites''\index{Make!prerequisites}. You specify a ``recipe''\index{Make!recipe} to create the targets from the prerequisites. The recipe is basically just the code you want to run to make the target file. The general form is:

\begin{knitrout}
    \definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}
    \color{fgcolor}
    \begin{kframe}
        \begin{verbatim}
TARGET ... : PREREQUISITE ...
    RECIPE
    ... 
    ...
            \end{verbatim}
        \end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}

Note that, unlike in R, tabs are important in Make. They indicate what lines are the recipe. Make uses the recipe to ensure that targets are newer than prerequisites. If a target is newer than its prerequisite, Make does not run the prerequisite.

The basic idea of reproducible data gathering with Make is similar to what we saw before, with a few twists and some new syntax. Let's see an example that does what we did before: gather data from three sources, clean and merge the data, and save it in CSV\index{CSV} format. 

\subsubsection{Example makefile}

The first thing we need to do is create a new file called \emph{Makefile}\footnote{Alternatively you can call the file \emph{GNUmakefile} or \emph{makefile}.} and place it in the same directory as the data gathering files we already have. The makefile we are going to create runs prerequisite files by the alphanumeric order of their file names. So we need to make sure that the files are named in the order that we want to run them. Now let's look at the actual makefile:

\begin{knitrout}
    \definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}
    \color{fgcolor}
    \begin{kframe}
        \begin{verbatim}

################

# Key variables to define
RDIR = .
MERGE_OUT = MergeData.Rout

# Create list of R source files
RSOURCE = $(wildcard $(RDIR)/*.R)

# Files to indicate when the RSOURCE file was run
OUT_FILES = $(RSOURCE:.R=.Rout)

# Default target
all: $(OUT_FILES) 

# Run the RSOURCE files
$(RDIR)/%.Rout: $(RDIR)/%.R
    R CMD BATCH $<

# Remove Out Files
clean: 
    rm -fv $(OUT_FILES)

# Remove MergeData.Rout
cleanMerge:
    rm -fv $(MERGE_OUT)
        \end{verbatim}
    \end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}

\noindent Ok, let's break down the code. The first part of the file defines variables that will be used later on. For example, in the first line of executable code (\texttt{RDIR = .}) we create a simple variable\footnote{Simple string variables are often referred to as ``macros''\index{Make!macros} in GNU Make. A common convention in Make and Unix-like shells generally is to use all caps for variable names.} called \texttt{ROUT} with a period (\texttt{.}) as its value. In Make and Unix-like shells, periods indicate the current directory. The next line allows us to specify a variable for the outfile created by running the \emph{MergeData.R} file. This will be useful later when we create a target for removing this file to ensure that the \emph{MergeData.R} file is always run.

The third executed line (\verb|RSOURCE:= $(wildcard $(RDIR)/*.R)|) creates a variable containing a list of all of the names of files with the extension \texttt{.R}, i.e. our data gathering and merge source code files. This line has some new syntax, so let's work through it. In Make (and Unix-like shells generally) a dollar sign (\verb|$|)\index{Make!\$} followed by a variable name substitutes the value of the variable in place of the name.\footnote{This is a kind of parameter expansion\index{parameter expansion}. For more information about parameter expansion see \cite{Frazier2008}.} For example, \verb|$(RDIR)| inserts the period \texttt{.} that we defined as the value of \texttt{RDIR} previously. The parentheses are included to clearly demarcate where the variable name begins and ends.\footnote{Braces (\texttt{\{\}}) are also sometimes used for this.} 

You may remember the asterisk (\verb|*|) from the previous chapter. It is a ``wildcard'',\index{wildcard}\label{AsteriskWildcard} a special character that allows you to select file names that follow a particular pattern. Using \verb|*.R| selects any file name that ends in \texttt{.R}.  

Why did we also include the actual word \texttt{wildcard}?\index{Make function!wildcard}\index{Make!wildcard} The \texttt{wildcard} function is different from the asterisk wildcard character. The function creates a list of files that match a pattern. In this case the pattern is \verb|$(RDIR)/*.R|. The general form for writing the \texttt{wildcard} function is: \verb|$(wildcard PATTERN)|.

The third line (\verb|OUT_FILES = $(RSOURCE:.R=.Rout)|) creates a variable for the \texttt{.Rout} files that Make will use to tell how recently each R file was run.\footnote{The R outfile contains all of the output from the R session used while running the file. These can be a helpful place to look for errors if your makefiles gives you an error like \texttt{make: *** [Gather.Rout] Error 1}.\index{Make!Error 1}} \verb|$(RSOURCE:.R=.Rout)| is a variable that uses the same file name as our RSOURCE files, but with the file extension \texttt{.Rout}.

The second part of the makefile tells Make what we want to create and how to create it. In the line \verb|all: $(OUT_FILES|) we are specifying the makefile's default target.\index{Make!targets} Targets are the files that you instruct Make to make. \texttt{all:} sets the default target; it is what Make tries to create when you enter the command \texttt{make} in the shell with no arguments. We will see later how to instruct Make to compile different targets.

The next two executable lines (\verb|$(RDIR)/%.Rout: $(RDIR)/%.R| and \verb|R CMD BATCH $<|) run the R source code files in the directory.  The first line specifies that the \texttt{.Rout} files are the targets of the \texttt{.R} files. The percent sign (\verb|%|) is another wildcard.\index{Make!\%} Unlike the asterisk, it replaces the selected file names throughout the command used to create the target.

The dollar and less than signs (\verb|$<|) indicate the first prerequisite for the target, i.e. the \texttt{.R} files. \texttt{R CMD BATCH}\index{R CMD BATCH} is a way to call R from a Unix-like shell, run source files, and output the results to other files.\footnote{You will need to make sure that R is in your PATH. Setting this up is different on different systems. If on Mac and Linux you can load R from the Terminal by typing \texttt{R}, R is in your PATH. The usual R installation usually sets this up correctly. There are different methods for changing the file path on different versions of Windows.} The outfiles it creates have the extension \texttt{.Rout}.

The next two lines specify another target: \texttt{clean}. When you type \texttt{make clean} into your shell Make will follow the recipe: \verb|rm -fv $(OUT_FILES)|.\index{shell command!rm} This removes (deletes) the \texttt{.Rout} files. The \texttt{f} argument (force) ignores  files that don't exist and the \texttt{v} argument (verbose) instructs Make to tell you what is happening when it runs. When you delete the \texttt{.Rout} files, Make will run all of the \texttt{.R} files the next time you call it.

The last two lines help us solve a problem created by the fact that our simple makefile doesn't push changes downstream. For example, if we make a change to \emph{Gather2.R} and run \texttt{make}, only \emph{Gather2.R} will be rerun. The new data frame will not be added to the final merged data set. To overcome this problem the last two lines of code create a target called \texttt{cleanMerge}, this removes only the \emph{MergeData.Rout} file. 

\paragraph{Running the MakeFile}

To run the makefile for the first time simply change the working directory to where the file is and type \texttt{make} into your shell. It will create the CSV final data file and four files with the extension \texttt{.Rout}, indicating when the segmented data gathering files were last run.\footnote{If you open these files you fill find the output from the R session used when the their source file was last run.}

When you run \verb|make| in the shell for the first time you should get the output:

\begin{knitrout}
    \definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}
    \color{fgcolor}
    \begin{kframe}
        \begin{verbatim}
## R CMD BATCH Gather1.R
## R CMD BATCH Gather2.R
## R CMD BATCH Gather3.R
## R CMD BATCH MergeData.R
            \end{verbatim}
        \end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}

\noindent If you run it a second time without changing the R source files you will get the following output:

\begin{knitrout}
    \definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}
    \color{fgcolor}
    \begin{kframe}
        \begin{verbatim}
## make: Nothing to be done for 'all'.
            \end{verbatim}
        \end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}

\noindent To remove all of the \texttt{.Rout} files set the make target to \texttt{clean}:\index{Make!clean}

\begin{knitrout}
    \definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}
    \color{fgcolor}
    \begin{kframe}
        \begin{verbatim}
make clean

## rm -fv ./Gather1.Rout ./Gather2.Rout ./Gather3.Rout 
## ./MergeData.Rout
## ./Gather1.Rout
## ./Gather2.Rout
## ./Gather3.Rout
## ./MergeData.Rout
            \end{verbatim}
        \end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}

\noindent If we run the following code:\label{MakeAllCommand}

<<Ch6MakeAll, eval=FALSE, engine='sh'>>=
# Remove MergeData.Rout and make all R source files
make cleanMerge all
@

\noindent then Make will first remove the \emph{MergeData.Rout} file (if there is one) and then run all of the R source files as need be. \emph{MergeData.R} will always be run. This ensures that changes to the gathered data frames are updated in the final merged data set.

\subsubsection{Makefiles and RStudio Projects}

You can run makefiles from RStudio's \emph{Build} tab.\index{RStudio!Build} For the type of makefile we have been using, the main advantage of running it from within RStudio is that you don't have to toggle between RStudio and the shell. Everything is in one place. 
Imagine that the directory with our makefile is an RStudio Project.\index{RStudio!Projects} If a Project already contains a makefile, RStudio will automatically open a \emph{Build} tab on the \emph{Workspace/History} pane, the same place where the \emph{Git} tab appears (see Figure \ref{BuildTab}).\footnote{If a project doesn't have a makefile you can still set up RStudio Build. Click on \texttt{Build} in the Menu bar then \texttt{Configure Build Tools . . .}. Select \texttt{Makefile} from the drop down menu then \texttt{Ok}. You will still need to manually add a Makefile in the Project's root directory.} 

The \emph{Build} tab has buttons you can click to \texttt{Build All} (this is equivalent to \texttt{make all}), and, in the \texttt{More} drop down menu, \texttt{Clean all} (\texttt{i.e. make clean}) and \texttt{i.e. Clean and Rebuild} (\texttt{make clean all}). As you can see in Figure \ref{BuildTab}, the Tab shows you the same output you get in the shell.

\begin{figure}
    \caption{The RStudio Build Tab}

            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Children/Chapter6/images6/BuildTab.png}
        \end{center}
\end{figure}  

\subsubsection{Other information about makefiles}

Note that Make relies heavily on commands and syntax of the shell program that you are using. The above example was written and tested on a Mac. It should work on other Unix-like computers without modification.

You can use Make to build almost any project from the shell, not just run R source code files. It was an integral part of early reproducible computational research \citep{Fomel2009, Buckheit1995}. Rob Hyndman more recently posted a description of the makefile he uses to create a project with R and LaTeX.\footnote{See his blog at: \url{http://robjhyndman.com/researchtips/makefiles/}. Posted 31 October 2012. This method largely replicates what we do in this book with \emph{knitr}. Nonetheless, it has helpful information about Make that can be used in other tasks. It was in fact helpful for writing this section of the book.} The complete source of information on GNU Make is the official online manual. It is available at: \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/}.

\section{Importing Locally Stored Data Sets}

Now that we've covered the big picture, let's learn the different tools you will need to know to gather data from different types of sources. The most straightforward place to load data from is a local file, e.g. one stored on your computer. Though storing your data locally does not really encourage reproducibility, most research projects will involve loading data this way at some point. The tools you will learn for importing locally stored data files will also be important for most of the other methods further on. 

Data stored in plain-text files on your computer can be loaded into R using the \texttt{read.table}\index{R command!read.table} command. For example, imagine we have a CSV file called \emph{TestData.csv} stored in the current working directory. To load the data set into R simply type:

<<Ch6LocalReadTable, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE>>=
TestData <- read.table("TestData.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
@

\noindent See Section \ref{SepHeadExplain} for a discussion of the arguments in this command.

If you are using RStudio you can do the same thing with drop down menus. To open a plain-text data file click on \texttt{Workspace} \textrightarrow\: \texttt{Import Dataset\ldots} \textrightarrow\: \texttt{From Text File\ldots}. In the box that pops up, specify the column separator, whether or not you want the first line to be treated as variable labels, and other options. This is initially easier than using \texttt{read.table}. But it is much less reproducible.

If the data is not stored in plain-text format, but is instead saved in a format created by another statistical program such as SPSS,\index{SPSS} SAS,\index{SAS} or Stata,\index{Stata} we can import it using commands in the \emph{foreign} package\index{foreign}. For example, imagine we have a data file called \emph{Data1.dta} stored in our working directory. This file was created by the Stata\index{Stata} statistical program. To load the data into an R data frame object called \emph{StataData} simply type:

<<Ch6Stata, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE>>=
# Load foreign package
library(foreign)

# Load Stata formatted data
StataData <- read.dta(file = "Data1.dta")
@

\noindent As you can see, commands in the \emph{foreign} package have similar syntax to \texttt{read.table}. To see the full range of commands and file formats that the \emph{foreign} package supports use the following command:

<<Ch6ForeignHelp, eval=FALSE>>=
library(help="foreign")
@

If you have data stored in a spreadsheet format such as Excel's\index{Microsoft Excel} \emph{.xlsx}, it may be best to first clean up the data in the spreadsheet program by hand and then save the file in plain-text format. When you clean up the data make sure that the first row has the variable names and that observations are in the following rows. Also, remove any extraneous information such as notes, colors, and so on that will not be part of the data frame.

To aid reproducibility, locally stored data should include careful documentation of where the data came from and how, if at all, it was transformed before it was loaded into R. Ideally the documentation would be written in a text file saved in the same directory as the raw data file. 

\section{Importing Data Sets from the Internet}

There are many ways to import data that is stored on the internet directly into R. We have to use different methods depending on where and how the data is stored. 

\subsection{Data from non-secure ({\tt{http}}) URLs}

Importing data into R that is located at a non-secure URL\index{URL}\footnote{URL stands for ``Uniform Resource Locator''.}--ones that start with {\tt{http}}\index{http}--is straightforward provided that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the data is stored in a simple format, e.g. plain-text,
    \item the file is not embedded in a larger HTML\index{HTML} website.
\end{itemize}

\noindent We already discussed the first issue in detail. You can determine if the data file is embedded in a website by opening the URL in your web browser. If you only see the raw plain-text data, you are probably good to go. To import the data simply include the URL as the file's name in your \texttt{read.table} command. 

\subsection{Data from secure ({\tt{https}}) URLs}\label{SecureDataDownload}

\noindent Storing data at non-secure URLs is becoming less common. Services like Dropbox and GitHub now store their data at secure URLs.\footnote{Dropbox used to host files in the Public folder at non-secure URLs, but recently switched to secure URLs.} You can tell if the data is stored at a secure web address if it begins with \texttt{https}\index{https} rather than \texttt{http}. We have to use different commands to download data from secure URLs. Let's look at three methods for downloading data into R: \verb|source_data|, \verb|source_DropboxData|, and the \emph{RCurl} package.

\paragraph{Loading data from secure URLs with {\tt{source\_data}}}\label{SecureData6}

As we saw in Chapter \ref{Storing}, we can use the \verb|source_data| command in the \emph{repmis} package to simplify the process of downloading data from Dropbox \emph{Public} folders (Section \ref{EnablePublicFolder}) and GitHub (Section \ref{GitDownload}).\index{repmis}\index{R command!source\_data} You can use \verb|source_data| to download data in plain-text format from almost any URL, as long as the file is not embedded in a larger HTML website. 

One problem for reproducible research with sourcing data located on the internet is that data files may change without us knowing. This could change the results we get. Luckily, we can solve this problem with \verb|source_data|. In Chapter \ref{Storing} we saw that when we run the \verb|source_data| command we not only download a data file, but also find its SHA-1 hash.\index{SHA-1 hash} The SHA-1 hash is basically a unique number for the file. If the file changes, its SHA-1 hash will change. Once we know the file's SHA-1 hash we can use \verb|source_data|'s \verb|sha1| argument to make sure the file that we downloaded is the same as the one we intended to download. 

For example, let's find the SHA-1 hash for the disproportionality data set we downloaded in the last chapter (Section \ref{GitDownload}):\footnote{Remember we placed the file's raw GitHub URL address inside of the object \emph{UrlAddress}.}

{\small{
<<Ch6sourceDataGitHub, tidy=FALSE>>=
DispropData <- repmis::source_data(UrlAddress)
@
}}

\noindent You can see that the file's SHA-1 hash begins \emph{\texttt{195637339e8483d}} \ldots. Let's see what happens when we try to download a slightly different version of the same file\footnote{The only difference is that the variable names begin with capital, rather than lowercase letters.} while placing this SHA-1 hash in \verb|source_url|'s \verb|sha1| argument. The URL of the alternative version of the file is in the object \emph{OldUrlAddress}:\footnote{See Section \ref{GitDownload} for the full URL.} 

{\footnotesize{
<<Ch6SHA1compare, tidy=FALSE>>=
DispropData <- repmis::source_data(OldUrlAddress, 
        sha1 = "195637339e8483dd634fae38e16ad8f24a403aef")
@
}}

\noindent If we set the \texttt{sha1} argument in our replication files others can be sure that they are using the same data files that we used to generate a particular result. It may not be practical to do this while a piece of research is under active development, as the files may be regularly updated. However, it can be very useful for source code files that underlie published results.

\paragraph{Loading data from Dropbox non-Public folders with {\tt{source\_DropboxData}}}\label{DropboxNonPublic}

Files stored on Dropbox\index{Dropbox}\index{Dropbox!non-Public folders} non-\emph{Public} folders are a little trickier to download. If you go to the Dropbox website and click the \texttt{Share Link} button next to a file (\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Children/Chapter5/images5/DropboxLink.png}) you will be taken to a new webpage. Notice that you get more than the raw file. The plain-text file is embedded in a larger HTML webpage. It is difficult to extract the data from this webpage. Luckily, \emph{repmis}\index{repmis} includes a \verb|source_DropboxData|\index{R command!source\_DropboxData} command for downloading data stored in a non-Public Dropbox folder into R. It works in much the same way as \verb|source_data|, the only difference is that instead of using the URL we need (a) the file's name and (b) its Dropbox key.\index{Dropbox!key}

To find the file's key simply click on the \texttt{Share Link} button next to the file (\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Children/Chapter5/images5/DropboxLink.png}) on the Dropbox website. Look at the URL for the webpage that appears. Here's an example:

\vspace{0.25cm}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Children/Chapter6/images6/DropboxURL.png}

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent You can see that the last part of the URL (\texttt{fin\_research\_note.csv}) is the data file's name. The key is the string of letters and numbers just after \texttt{https://www.dropbox.com/s/}, i.e. \texttt{exh4iobbm2p5p1v}. Now that we have the file name and key we can download the data into R using \verb|source_DropboxData|. For example:

<<Ch6sourceDropboxData, tidy=FALSE>>=

\paragraph{Loading data using {\normalfont{RCurl}}}

A more laborious way to download data from a secure URL that does not rely on \emph{repmis} is to use the \texttt{getURL}\index{getURL}\index{R command!getURL} command in the {\emph{RCurl}} package \cite[]{R-RCurl} as well as \verb|read.table|\index{R command!read.table} and \texttt{textConnection}.\index{R command!textConnection} The latter commands are in base R. The two rules about data being stored in plain text-formats and not being embedded in a larger HTML website apply to this method as well.

Let's try an example. To download the data file we used in Section \ref{GitDownload} it into R we could use this code:

{\small
<<Ch6httpsLoad, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, tidy=FALSE>>=
# Put URL address into the object UrlAddress
UrlAddress <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/",
                    "christophergandrud/Disproportionality_Data/",
                    "master/Disproportionality.csv")

# Download Electoral disproportionality data
DataUrl <- RCurl::getURL(UrlAddress)

# Convert Data into a data frame
DispropData <- read.table(textConnection(DataUrl), 
                                     sep = ",", 
                                     header = TRUE)
                    
# Show variables in data
names(DispropData)
@
}

\noindent If running \texttt{getURL(UrlAddress)} gives you an error about an \texttt{SSL certificate problem} simply add the argument \texttt{ssl.verifypeer = FALSE}. This allows you to skip certification verification and access the data.\footnote{For more details see the \emph{RCurl} help page at \url{http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl/FAQ.html}.} 

\subsection{Compressed data stored online}

Sometimes data files are large, making them difficult to store and download without compressing\index{file compression} them. There are a number of compression methods such as Zip\index{Zip} and Tar\index{Tar}.\footnote{Tar archives are sometimes referred to as `tar balls'.\index{tar balls}} Zip files have the extension {\tt{.zip}} and Tar files use extensions such as {\tt{.tar}} and {\tt{.gz}}. In most cases\footnote{Some formats that require the {\emph{foreign}} package to open are more difficult. This is because functions such as {\tt{read.dta}} for opening Stata {\tt{.dta}} files only accept file names or URLs as arguments, not connections, which you create for unzipped files.} you can download, decompress, and create data frame objects from these files directly in R. To do this you need to:\footnote{The description of this process is based on a Stack Overflow comment by Dirk Eddelbuettel (see {\url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3053833/using-r-to-download-zipped-data-file-extract-and-import-data?answertab=votes\#tab-top}}, posted 10 June 2010.)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item create a temporary file with {\tt{tempfile}} to store the zipped file, which you will later remove with the {\tt{unlink command}}\index{R command!unlink} at the end,
    \item download the file with {\tt{download.file}},\index{R command!download.file}
    \item decompress the file with one of the {\tt{connections}}\index{R command!connections} commands in base R,\footnote{To find a full list of commands type {\tt{?connections}} into the R console.}
    \item read the file with {\tt{read.table}}.\index{R command!read.table} 
\end{itemize}

\noindent The reason that we have to go through so many extra steps is that compressed files are more than just a single file and contain a number of files as well as metadata.\index{metadata}

Let's download a compressed file called {\emph{uds\_summary.csv}} from \cite{Pemstein2010}. It's in a compressed file called {\emph{uds\_summary.csv.gz}}. The file's URL address is {\url{http://www.unified-democracy-scores.org/files/20140312/z/uds_summary.csv.gz}}, that I shortened\footnote{I used bitly (\url{bitly.com}) to shorten the URL.} to \url{http://bit.ly/1jXJgDh} because of space constraints.

{\footnotesize
<<Ch5ZipDownload, warning=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, cache=TRUE>>=
# For simplicity, store the URL in an object called 'url'.
url <- "http://bit.ly/1jXJgDh"
 
# Create a temporary file called 'temp' to put the zip file into.
temp <- tempfile()
 
# Download the compressed file into the temporary file.
download.file(url, temp)
 
# Decompress the file and convert it into a dataframe
# class object called 'data'.
UDSData <- read.csv(gzfile(temp, "uds_summary.csv"))
 
# Delete the temporary file.
unlink(temp)
 
# Show variables in data
names(UDSData)
@ 
}

\subsection{Data APIs \& feeds}

There are a growing number of packages that can gather data directly from a variety of internet sources and import them into R. Most of these packages use the sources' application programming interfaces (API).\index{API} APIs allow programs to interact with a website. Needless to say, this is great for reproducible research. It not only makes the data gathering process easier as you don't have to download many Excel files and fiddle around with them before even getting the data into R, but it also makes replicating the data gathering process much more straightforward and makes it easy to update data sets when new information becomes available. Some examples of these packages include: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{openair} package \citep{R-openair},\index{openair} which beyond providing a number of tools for analyzing air quality data also has the ability to directly gather data directly from sources such as Kings College London's London Air (\url{http://www.londonair.org.uk/}) database.\index{air quality}
    \item The \emph{quantmod} package \citep{R-quantmod} allows you to access data from Google Finance,\footnote{\url{http://www.google.com/finance}} Yahoo Finance,\footnote{\url{http://finance.yahoo.com/}} and the US Federal Reserve's FRED\footnote{\url{http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/}} economic database.\index{finance data}\index{Google!Finance}\index{Yahoo Finance}\index{US Federal Reserve}
    \item The \emph{treebase} package by \cite{Boettiger2012} allows you to access phylogenetic\index{phylogenetic} data from TreeBASE.\footnote{\url{http://treebase.org}}\index{treebase}
    \item The \emph{twitteR} package \citep{R-twitteR} accesses Twitter's\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/}} API. This allows you to download data from Twitter\index{Twitter} including tweets\index{tweet} and trending topics.\index{twitteR}
    \item The \emph{WDI} package \citep{R-WDI} allows you to directly download data from the World Bank's\index{World Bank}\index{WDI} Development Indicators database.\footnote{\url{http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators}} This database includes numerous country-level economic, health, and environment variables. 
    \item The rOpenSci\footnote{\url{http://ropensci.org/}}\index{rOpenSci} group has and is developing a number of packages for accessing scientific data from web-based sources with R. They have a comprehensive set of packages for accessing biological data and academic journals. For a list of their packages see: \url{http://ropensci.org/packages/index.html}. 
    \item Stack Exchange's\index{Stack Exchange} Cross Validated\index{Cross Validated} website\footnote{{\small{\url{http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/12670/data-apis- feeds-available-as-packages-in-r}}}} also has a fairly comprehensive and regularly updated list of APIs accessible from R packages.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{API Package Example: World Bank Development Indicators}

Each of these packages has its own syntax and it isn't possible to go over all of them here. Nonetheless, let's look at an example of accessing World Bank data with the \emph{WDI}\index{WDI}\index{World Bank} to give you a sense of how these packages work. Imagine that we want to gather data on fertilizer consumption.\index{fertilizer} We can use \emph{WDI}'s \texttt{WDIsearch} command to find fertilizer consumption data available at the World Bank:

{\small
<<Ch6WDIsearch>>=
# Load WDI package 
library(WDI)

# Search World Bank for fertilizer consumption data
WDIsearch("fertilizer consumption")
@
}

\noindent This shows us a selection of indicator numbers and their names.\footnote{You can also search the World Bank Development Indicators website. The indicator numbers are at the end of each indicator's URL.} Let's gather data on countries' fertilizer consumption in kilograms per hectare of arable land. The indicator number for this variable is: AG.CON.FERT.ZS. We can use the command \texttt{WDI} to gather the data and put it in an object called \emph{FertConsumpData}.

<<Ch6WDIFert, eval=TRUE>>=
FertConsumpData <- WDI(indicator = "AG.CON.FERT.ZS")
@

\noindent The data we downloaded looks like this:

<<Ch6WDIFertSave, include=FALSE>>=
# This ensures that the PDF will still compile even if the data is unavailable via WDI
#load(file = "Source/Children/Chapter6/FertData.RData")
@

<<Ch6HeadFert>>=
head(FertConsumpData)
@

\noindent You can see that \texttt{WDI} has downloaded data for four variables: \textbf{iso2c},\footnote{This is the countries' or regions' International Standards Organization's\index{ISO} two letter codes. For more details see: \url{http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes.htm}.} \textbf{country}, \textbf{AG.CON.FERT.ZS} and \textbf{year}.

\section{Advanced Automatic Data Gathering: Web Scraping}

If a package does not already exist to access data from a particular website there are other ways to automatically ``scrape'' data from the website with R.\index{web scraping} This section briefly discusses some of R's web scraping tools and techniques to get you headed in the right direction to do more advanced data gathering.

\paragraph{The general process}

Simple web scraping involves downloading a file from the internet, parsing\index{parse} it (i.e. reading it), and extracting the data you are interested in then putting it into a data frame object. We already saw a simple example of this when we downloaded data from the a secure HTTPS website. We downloaded a website's content from a URL address into R with the \texttt{getURL}\index{R command!getURL} command. We then parsed the downloaded text as a CSV formatted data file, extracted it, and put it into a new data frame object. 

This was a relatively simple process, because the webpage was very simply formatted. It basically only contained the CSV formatted text. So, the process of parsing and extracting the data was very straightforward. You may not be so lucky with other data sources. Data may be stored in an HTML\index{HTML} formatted table within a more complicated HTML marked up webpage. The \emph{XML}\index{XML} package \citep{R-XML} has a number of useful commands such as \texttt{readHTMLTable}\index{R command!readHTMLTable} for parsing and extracting this kind of data. The \emph{XML} package also clearly has functions for handling XML formatted data.\footnote{XML stands for ``Extensible Markup Language''}\index{XML} If the data is stored in JSON\footnote{JSON means ``JavaScript Object Notation''}\index{JSON} you can read it with the \emph{rjson} \citep{R-rjson}\index{rjson} or \emph{RJSONIO} \citep{R-RJSONIO}\index{RJSONIO} packages.

There are more websites with APIs\index{API} than R packages designed specifically to access each one. If an API is available the \emph{httr} package \citep{R-httr}\index{httr}  may be useful. It is a wrapper\index{wrapper} for \emph{RCurl} intended to make accessing APIs easier. 

As of the time when I was writing this book Brian Abelson's \emph{scraply} \index{scraply} package was not on CRAN.\index{CRAN} It may turn out to be a useful addition to the R web scraping tool chest. It looks like an especially promising way of handling errors that might occur while scraping a website. Errors are a persistent issue in web scraping. More information is available at the package's GitHub site: \url{https://github.com/abelsonlive/scraply/}.

\paragraph{More tools to learn for web scraping}

Beyond learning about the various R packages that are useful for R web scraping, an aspiring web scraper should probably invest time learning a number of other skills:

\begin{itemize}
    \item HTML:\index{HTML} Obviously you will encounter a lot of HTML markup when web scraping. Having a good understanding of the HTML markup language will be very helpful. W3 Schools (\url{http://www.w3schools.com/}) is a free resource for learning HTML as well as JSON, JavaScript, XML, and other languages you will likely come across while web scraping.
    \item Regular Expressions:\index{regular expressions} Web scraping often involves finding character patterns. Some of this is done for you by the R packages above that parse text. There are times, however, when you are looking for particular patterns, like tag\index{HTML tag} IDs that are particular to a given website and change across the site based on a particular pattern. You can use regular expressions to deal with these situations. R has a comprehensive if bare bones introduction to regular expressions. To access it type \verb|?regex|\index{R!regex} into your R console.
    \item Looping:\index{loop} Web scraping often involves applying a function to multiple things, e.g. tables or HTML tags. To do this in an efficient way you will need to use loops and apply functions\index{R!apply functions}. \cite{Matloff2011} provides a comprehensive overview. The \emph{plyr} package \citep{R-plyr}\index{plyr} and \citep{R-dplyr}\index{dplyr} (for data frames) are also particularly useful.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Chapter Summary}

In this chapter we have learned how to reproducibly gather data from a number of sources. If the data we are using is available online we may be able to create really reproducible data gathering files. These files have commands that others can execute with makefiles that allow them to actually regather the exact data we used. The techniques we can use to gather online data also make it easy to update our data when new information becomes available. Of course it may not always be possible to have really reproducible data gathering. Nonetheless, you should always aim to make it clear to others (and yourself) how you gathered your data. In the next chapter we will learn how to clean and merge multiple data files so that they can easily be used in our statistical analyses.
