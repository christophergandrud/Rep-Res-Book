# Showing Results with Figures {#FiguresChapter}

One of the main reasons that many people use R is to take advantage of
its comprehensive and powerful set of data visualization tools. Visually
displaying information with graphics is often a much more effective way
of presenting both descriptive statistics and analysis results than the
tables we covered in the last chapter.[^chapter_10_1]

Nonetheless, dynamically incorporating figures with knitr/R Markdown
has many of the same benefits as dynamically including tables,
especially the ability to have data set or analysis changes
automatically cascade into your presentation documents. The basic
process for including figures in knitted presentation documents is also
very similar to including tables, though there are some important extra
considerations we need to make to properly size the figures and be able
to include interactive visualizations in our presentation documents.

In this chapter we will first learn how to include non-knitted
graphics in LaTeX and Markdown documents before turning
to dynamically knit R graphics into presentation documents. In the
remainder of the chapter, we will look at how to actually create graphics
with R including some of the fundamentals of R's default graphics
package, as well as the *ggplot2* [@R-ggplot2] and *googleVis*
[@R-googleVis] packages. In each case we will focus on how to include
the figures created by these packages in knitted presentation documents.

## Including Non-knitted Graphics

Understanding how *knitr*/*rmarkdown* dynamically include figures is
easier if you understand how figures are normally included in LaTeX and
Markdown. Unlike a word processing program like Microsoft Word, in
LaTeX, Markdown, HTML, and other markup languages you don't copy and
paste figures into your document. Instead, you link to an image file
outside of your markup document. Typically these image files are in
formats such as *PDF*, *PNG*, and *JPEG*.[^chapter_10_2]\index{PNG}\index{JPEG}

While you lose the flexibility of drag and drop, there are advantages to this method of including graphics. The first is that whenever the image files are changed, the
changes are updated in the final presentation document when it is
compiled, no recopying and pasting. The second advantage is that the
images are sized and placed with the markup code rather than pointing
and clicking. This is tedious at first, but saves considerable time and
frustration when a document becomes larger. It also makes it easy to
consistently format multiple images in a document.

If the image files are in the same directory as the markup document, we
don't need to specify the image's full file path, only its name. If they are
in another directory, we need to include additional file path
information. Remember to use relative paths when possible. In this
section we will learn how to include graphics files in documents created
with LaTeX and Markdown.

### Including graphics in LaTeX

The main way to include graphics (graphs, photos, and so on) in LaTeX
documents is to use the `includegraphics` function\index{LaTeX!includegraphics} to link to image
files. To have the full range of features for `includegraphics`, make
sure to load the *graphicx* package in your document's preamble.\index{graphicx} Imagine
that we wanted to include an image of butterflies stored in a file
called *HeliconiusMimicry.png* in a LaTeX-produced document.[^chapter_10_3] We
type:

````latex
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{HeliconiusMimicry.png}
````

In the square brackets, you'll notice `scale=0.8`. This formats the image
to be included at 80 percent of its actual size. You can use other
options such as `height` to specify the height, `width` to specify the
width, and `angle` to specify the angle at which to rotate the image.
You can add more than one option if they are separated by commas. Rather
than hard coding the width in exact centimeters, you can determine its
width as a proportion of the text width using `\textwidth`.[^chapter_10_4]\index{LaTeX!textwidth} For
example, to set our image at 80 percent of the text width we can type:

````latex
\includegraphics[scale=0.8\textwidth]{HeliconiusMimicry.png}
````

#### `figure` float environment {-}

\index{LaTeX!float|(}

Most often you will want to include LaTeX figures in a `figure` float
environment.\index{LaTeX!figure environment} The *figure* environment works almost exactly the same way as the `table` environment we saw in the last chapter. It allows you to
separate the figure from the text, add a caption, and label the figure.
We begin the environment with `\begin{figure}[POSITION_SPEC]`.
`POSITION_SPEC` can have the same values as we saw earlier with tables
in Chapter \@ref(TablesChapter). We can then include a `caption` and `label` function.\index{LaTeX!label}\index{LaTeX!caption} The
environment is closed with `\end{figure}`. For example, to create Figure \@ref(fig:ExampleLaTeXFigure) exactly as is, I used the following code:[^chapter_10_5]

````latex
\begin{figure}[ht]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics{HeliconiusMimicry.png}
        \end{center}
    \caption{An Example Figure in LaTeX}
    {\scriptsize{Image source: \cite{meyer2006}}}
    \label{ExampleLaTeXFigure}
\end{figure}
````

Notice that after the call to end the `center` environment we include
`{\scriptsize{Source: \cite{meyer2006}}}`. This includes a note
in the figure environment giving the image's source. The note moves with
the figure and is separate from the text. The `scriptsize` function\index{LaTeX!scriptsize}
transforms the text to smaller than normal size font. See Chapter \@ref(LatexChapter)
for more details on LaTeX font sizes. The function `\cite{meyer2006}`
inserts a citation from the bibliography for @meyer2006. We will
also discuss bibliographies in more detail in Chapter \@ref(LatexChapter).\index{LaTeX!cite}

\begin{figure}[ht]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics{images/chapter_10/HeliconiusMimicry.png}
        \end{center}
    \caption{An Example Figure in LaTeX}
    {\scriptsize{Image source: \cite{meyer2006}}}
    \label{fig:ExampleLaTeXFigure}
\end{figure}

\index{LaTeX!float|)}

### Including graphics in Markdown/HTML

Markdown has a similar function as LaTeX's `includegraphics`. It goes
like this: `![ALT_TEXT](FILE_PATH)`. This syntax may seem strange now,
but it will hopefully make more sense when we cover Markdown hyperlinks
in Chapter \@ref(MarkdownChapter). This is what it is intended to imitate.
`ALT_TEXT` refers to HTML's `alt` (alternative text) attribute.\index{HTML!alt} This
should be a very short description of the image that will appear if it
fails to load in a web browser. `FILE_PATH` specifies the image's file
path.[^chapter_10_6] Here is an example using the image we worked with
before.

````markdown
![ButterflyImage](HeliconiusMimicry.png)
````

Note that the file path can be a URL. You may, for example, store an
image on GitHub and use its raw URL to link
to it in the Markdown document.[^chapter_10_7]

Markdown does not easily include ways to resize or reposition an image.
If you want to resize or reposition
your image, it is often most straightforward to use HTML markup. Probably the simplest way
to include images with HTML is by using the `img` (image)\index{HTML!img} element tag.\index{HTML!tag}
To create the equivalent of what we just did in Markdown with HTML, type:

````html
<img src="HeliconiusMimicry.png" alt="ButterflyImage"></img>
````

The `src` (script)\index{HTML!src} attribute specifies the file path. To change the width and height of the image, use the `width` and `height`
attributes.\index{HTML!width}\index{HTML!height} For example:

````html
<img src="HeliconiusMimicry.png" alt="ButterflyImage"
     width="100px" height="100px">
</img>
````

creates an image that is 100 pixels (`px`) wide by 100 pixels high.[^chapter_10_8]\index{HTML!px} It is also possible to specify the alignment of figures in Markdown with a custom CSS\index{CSS} style file. I don't cover how to do that here.

### Non-knitted graphics with *knitr*/*rmarkdown*

Now that we've seen how LaTeX, Markdown, and HTML include non-dynamically generated graphics, it raises a question: how do we include these graphics in a document that we intend to use *R Markdown* to compile to more than one of these formats? *knitr* includes the
`include_graphics()` function just for this purpose.\index{R function!include\_graphics}

For example, in a code chunck place:

````r
`r ''````{r fig.cap="An Example Figure"}
knitr::include_graphics('HeliconiusMimicry.png')
```
````

Now the figure will be included regardless of which markup language we compile to.
Notice the code chunk option `fig.cap`. In the next section, we dicuss this type of *knitr* options in detail.

## Basic *knitr*/*rmarkdown* Figure Options

In addition to including precompiled images with the  `include_graphics()` function, *knitr*, and by extension
*rmarkdown*, allows us to combine a figure's creation by R with its
inclusion in a presentation document. They are tied together and update
together. We use *knitr* chunk options to specify how the figure will
look in the presentation document and where it will be saved. We can also use them to specify captions.  Let's
learn some of the more important chunk options for figures.

### Chunk options

#### `fig.path` {-}

\index{knitr option!fig.path|(}

When you use *knitr* to create and include figures in your presentation
documents, it (1) runs the code you give it to create the figure, (2)
automatically saves it into a particular directory,[^chapter_10_9] and (3) includes
the necessary LaTeX or Markdown code to include the figure in the final
presentation document. By default, *knitr* saves images into a folder (it
creates) called *figure* located in the working directory.[^chapter_10_10] You can
tell *knitr* where to save the images with the `fig.path` option. Simply
use the file path naming conventions suitable for your system and
include the new path in quotation marks.

Note if you use *rmarkdowm* to compile to HTML, by default the graphic will not be saved
in a separate file, but instead converted to a format that is embedded directly in the HTML markup document.

\index{knitr option!fig.path|)}

#### `out.height` {-}

\index{knitr option!out.height}

To set the height that a figure will be in the final presentation
document, use the `out.height` option. In R LaTeX documents, you can set
the width using centimeters, inches, or as a proportion of a page
element. In R Markdown documents, you use pixels to set the height. For
example, to set a figure's height in an R Markdown document to 200
pixels, use `out.height='200px'`.

#### `out.width` {-}

\index{knitr option!out.width}

Similarly, we can set the width of a *knitr* created figure using the
`out.width` option. The same rules apply as with `out.width`. For
example, to have a figure shown up at 80 percent of the text width in an
R LaTeX document, use: `out.width='0.8\\textwidth'`.\index{LaTeX!textwidth} Notice that
there are two backslashes before `textwidth`. As we saw earlier, the
LaTeX function only has one. However, all *knitr* code chunk options must
be written as they would be in R. We need to escape the backslash with
the backslash escape character, i.e. use two backslashes.

#### `fig.align` {-}

\index{knitr option!fig.align}

You can set a knitted figure's alignment using `fig.align`. The option
can be set to `left`, `center`, or `right`. To center a figure, add
`fig.align='center'`.

#### `fig.cap` {-}

\index{knitr option!fig.cap}

If your document compiles to LaTeX, you can use the `fig.cap` option to set the figure's
caption as we did in the example above.

#### Other figure chunk options {-}

The previous options are probably the most commonly used ways of
adjusting figures with *knitr*. However, *knitr* has many other chunk
options to help you adjust your figures so that they are incorporated
into your presentation documents the way that you want. For example, the option `fig.lb` allows you to set the label.[^chapter_10_11] As we will see below, you can use the `dev` option to choose the figure's output file format, e.g. PDF, PNG,
JPEG. Please see the official *knitr* code chunk options webpage for
more information on figure chunk options: <https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk_options>.

### Global options

If you want all of your figures to share the same options---e.g. same
height and alignment---you can set global figure options at the beginning
of your document with `opts_chunk$set`. Imagine that we are making an R
LaTeX Sweave-style document and want all of our figures to be center
aligned and 80 percent of the text width. We type:

````r
opts_chunk$set.(fig.align = "center",
                out.width = "0.8\\textwidth")
````

You can also set some global figure options, such as `fig_height` and
`fig_width` in your *rmarkdown* YAML header.\index{YAML}

## Knitting R's Default Graphics

R's *graphics* package, loaded by default, includes functions to create
numerous plot types. These include `hist()`\index{R function!hist} for histograms, `pairs()`\index{R function!pairs} for
scatterplot matrices, `boxplot()`\index{R function!boxplot} for creating boxplots, and the versatile
`plot()`\index{R function!plot} for creating x-y plots, including scatterplots and bar charts depending on the data's type.

There are many useful resources for learning how to fully utilize R's
default graphics capabilities. These include Paul Murrell's
[-@murrell2011] comprehensive *R Graphics* book. The Cookbook for
R[^chapter_10_12] and Quick-R[^chapter_10_13] websites are also helpful. Winston Chang [-@chang2012],
the maintainer of the Cookbook for R, also has a full book devoted to
creating R graphics. Kieran Healy [-@healy2018data] is a strong intoduction to data visualisation in general with R examples.

In this section we are going to see how to include R's default graphics
in our LaTeX and Markdown presentation documents. We will also see an
example of how to source the creation of a graph from a segmented
analysis file. Most of R's default graphics capabilities create static
graphics. They are not animations or interactive. The discussion in this
section is exclusively about using static graphics with
*knitr*/*rmarkdown*. Later in the chapter, we will discuss how to knit
interactive graphics.

Let's look at an example we first saw at the end of Chapter \@ref(StatsModel). Remember that we accessed an R source
code file stored on GitHub to create a simple scatterplot of cars' speed
and stopping distances using R's *cars* data set, which is loaded by
default. We haven't yet seen the code in the R source file that created
the plot.

In the *cars* data frame, the variable **speed** contains the stopping speed, and
**dist** contains the stopping distances. Here is the code to create the
plot:

```{r Ch10CarsPlotCode, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
# Create simple scatterplot of cars' speed and stopping distance
plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist,
     xlab = "Speed (mph)",
     ylab = "Stopping Distance (ft)",
     cex.lab = 1.5)
```

We select the variables from *cars* to plot on the $x$- and $y$-axes of
our graph with the component selector (`$`).\index{component selector} Then we use the `xlab` and `ylab` arguments to specify the $x$- and $y$-axes labels. We could have
added a title for the plot using the `main` argument. We didn't do this
because we will give the plot a title in the LaTeX `figure` environment.\index{LaTeX!figure}
The `cex.lab` argument increased the labels' font size. The argument
specifically determines how to scale the labels relative to the default
size: 1.5 means 50 percent larger than the default.

Now let's see how to create this plot with *knitr* and include it in a
LaTeX `figure` environment.

````latex
\begin{figure}[ht]
`r ''````{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='8cm'}
    plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist,
         xlab = "Speed (mph)",
         ylab = "Stopping Distance (ft)",
         cex.lab = 1.5)
```
    \caption{Example Simple Scatterplot Using \texttt{plot}}
    \label{BasicFigureExample}
\end{figure}
````

\begin{figure}[ht]
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='8cm'}
    plot(x = cars$speed, y = cars$dist,
         xlab = "Speed (mph)",
         ylab = "Stopping Distance (ft)",
         cex.lab = 1.5)
```
  \caption{Example Simple Scatter Plot Using \texttt{plot}}
  \label{fig:BasicFigureExample}
\end{figure}

This code produces Figure \@ref(fig:BasicFigureExample).[^chapter_10_14] If you are familiar with R
graphics, you will notice that we did not need to tell *knitr* to save
the file in a particular format. Instead, behind the scenes it
automatically saves the plot as a PDF file in a folder called *figure*
that is a child of the current working directory. You can choose the
figure file's format with the `dev` (graphical device) chunk
option.\index{knitr option!dev} For example, to save the
figure in a PNG formatted file, add the chunk option `dev='PNG'`.
You can choose any graphical device format supported by R. For a full
list of R's graphical devices, type `?Devices` into your console. One
reason you might want to change the format is to reduce your
presentation document's file size. Using a bitmap format like PNG will
create smaller files than PDFs, though lower-quality images.

We could, of course, link to the original R source code file
stored on GitHub with the `source_url()` function.\index{R function:source\_url} Let's look at an example
of this with a different source code file. Remember in Chapter \@ref(DataGather) we used a makefile to gather data from three
different sources on the internet. The CSV is called *main-data.csv* and
is stored on GitHub at: <http://bit.ly/V0ldsf>.[^chapter_10_15] We can download this data into R and make the following scatterplot matrix (Figure \@ref(fig:BasicFigureExample)) with this code:

```{r Ch10ScatterPlotMatrix, tidy=FALSE, fig.cap='Example of a Scatterplot Matrix', fig.lb='ScatterMatrix'}
# Download data
main_data <- rio::import("http://bit.ly/V0ldsf",
                        format = "csv" )

# Subset main_data so that it only includes the year 2003
data_sub <- subset(main_data, year == 2003)

# Remove iso2c, country, year variables
# Keep reg_4state, disproportionality, FertilizerConsumption
data_sub <- data_sub[, c("reg_4state", "disproportionality",
                       "FertilizerConsumption")]

# Create a scatterplot matrix
pairs(x = data_sub)
```

This is a lot of code, but you should be familiar with most of it. You
will notice that after downloading the data we cleaned it up in
preparation for plotting with the `pairs()`\index{R function!pairs} function by removing data from
all years other than 2003 and all of the country-year identifying
variables. Finally, we created the scatterplot matrix with `pairs()`.

To dynamically include the plot in our final document, we don't need to
include all of this code in a code chunk in our markup document. A file
containing the code is available on GitHub.[^chapter_10_16] So we only need to use `source_url()`\index{R function!source\_url} to link to it. I've shortened the raw source code file's
URL to: <http://bit.ly/TE0gTc>. Let's look at the syntax for knitting
this into an R Markdown file:

````r
`r ''````{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Example of a Scatterplot Matrix'}
# Create scatterplot matrix from main-data.csv
devtools::source_url("http://bit.ly/TE0gTc")
```
````

Because we have linked all the way
back to the original data set *main-data*, any time it is updated by
the makefile, the update will automatically cascade all the way through
to our final presentation document the next time we knit it.

## Including *ggplot2* Graphics

\index{ggplot2|(}\index{R function!ggplot|(}

The *ggplot2* package[^chapter_10_17] [@R-ggplot2] is probably one of the most
popular packages for making graphics with R. It greatly expands the
aesthetic and substantive tools R has for displaying quantitative
information. Figures created with *ggplot2* are (generally) static,[^chapter_10_18]
so they are included in knitted documents the same way as most of R's
default graphics.

There are a number of very good resources for learning how to use
*ggplot2*. These include Hadley Wickham's *ggplot2* book
[-@whickham2009book] and article [-@whickham2010journal]. The official
*ggplot2* website[^chapter_10_19] has up-to-date information. I've also found the
Cookbook for R website helpful.[^chapter_10_20]

Given that there is already extensive good documentation on *ggplot2*, we
are not going to learn the full details of how to use the package here.
Instead, let's look at some examples of how to manipulate a data frame
and a regression results object so that they can be graphed with
*ggplot2*. First we will create a multi-line time series plot. Then we
will create a caterpillar plot of regression results. Along with giving
you a general sense of how *ggplot2* works, the examples illuminate how
*ggplot2* can be made part of a fully reproducible research
workflow.[^chapter_10_21]

Sometimes we may want to show how multiple variables change together
overtime. For example, imagine we have data on inflation in the United
States along with inflation forecasts made by the US Federal Reserve two
quarters beforehand. The data is stored on GitHub at:
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Examples/master/Graphs/InflationData.csv>.[^chapter_10_22]
I've loaded the data into R and put it into an object called
*inflation_data*. It looks like this:

```{r Ch10Loadinflation_data, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Create URL object
inflation_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Examples/master/Graphs/InflationData.csv"

# Load data
inflation_data <- rio::import(inflation_url, format = "csv")
```

```{r Ch10Headinflation_data}
names(inflation_data)
```

We want to create a plot with **Quarter** as the $x$-axis, inflation as
the $y$-axis, and two lines. One line will represent **ActualInflation**
and the other **EstimatedInflation**. To do this, we need to reshape our
data so that the inflation variables are in long format like this:

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
    \hline
    Quarter & Variable & Value \\[0.25cm]
    \hline\hline
    1969.1 & ActualInflation & \\
    1969.1 & EstimatedInflation & \\
    1969.2 & ActualInflation & \\
    1969.2 & EstimatedInflation & \\
    \ldots & & \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\vspace{0.5cm}

We can use the `pivot_longer` function from *tidyr* that we first saw in
Chapter \@ref(DataClean) to reshape the data. The variable identifying the observations in this case is `Quarter`. The
**ActualInflation** and **EstimatedInflation** variables (in columns two
and three) are the variables that we want to pivot. So let's pivot the
data:

```{r Ch10GatherInflation, message=FALSE}
library(tidyr)

# Pivot inflation_data
inflation_long <- pivot_longer(inflation_data, cols = 2:3,
                               names_to = "variable")

inflation_long
```

Now we have a data set we can use to create our line graph with
*ggplot2*.

Let's cover a few basic *ggplot2* ideas that will help us understand the
following code better. First, plots are composed of layers including the
coordinate system, points, labels, and so on. Each layer has aesthetics,
including the variables plotted on the $x$-and $y$-axes, label sizes,
colors, and shapes. Aesthetic elements are defined by the `aes()`
argument. Finally, the main layer types are called geometrics, including
lines, points, bars, and text. Functions that set geometrics usually
begin with `geom`. For example, the geometric to create lines is
`geom_line()`.\index{R function!geom\_line}\index{R function!ggplot}

```{r Ch10ggplot2Lines, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Create plot
line_plot <- ggplot(data = inflation_long,
                    aes(x = Quarter, y = value,
                      color = variable, linetype = variable)) +
                    geom_line() +
                    scale_color_discrete(name = "",
                           labels = c("Actual", "Estimated")) +
                    scale_linetype(name = "",
                           labels = c("Actual", "Estimated")) +
                    xlab("Quarter") + ylab("Inflation") +
                    theme_bw(base_size = 15)
```

\index{R function!scale\_color\_discrete}\index{R function!scale\_linetype}\index{R function!xlab}\index{R function!ylab}\index{R function!aes}

You can see we set the $x$- and $y$-axes using the **Quarter** and
**value** variables. We told *ggplot* that elements in the geometric
layer should have lines with different colors and line types (dashed,
dotted, and so on) based on the value of **variable** that they
represent. `geom_line` specifies that we want to add a line geometric
layer.[^chapter_10_23] `scale_color_discrete()` and `scale_linetype()` are used here to
hide the plot's legend title with `name = ""` and customize the legend's
labels with `labels = . . .`. You can also use them to determine the
specific colors and line types you would like to use. `xlab()` and `ylab()`
set the axes' labels. You can add a title with `ggtitle`. Finally, I
added `theme_bw()` so that the plot would use a simple black-and-white
theme. We added the argument `base_size = 15` to increase the plot's
font size.

All of the code required to create this graph is on GitHub at:
<https://bit.ly/2FaMkOJ>.[^chapter_10_24] To knit the graph into a LaTeX document manually specifying the figure environment, type: \index{LaTeX environment!figure}

````latex
\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Example Multi-line Time Series Plot Created with
  \emph{ggplot2}} \label{ggplot2Line}
    \begin{center}
`r ''````{r echo=FALSE, out.width='10cm'out.height='8cm'}
    # Create plot
    devtools::source_url("https://bit.ly/2FaMkOJ")
```
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
````

```{r Ch10MultiLines, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='10cm', out.height='8cm', fig.cap='\\emph{ggplot2} Time Series Line Plot'}
# Create plot
devtools::source_url("https://bit.ly/2FaMkOJ")
```

The syntax for including this and other *ggplot2* figures in an R
Markdown document is the same as we saw for default R graphics.

### Showing regression results with caterpillar plots

Many packages that estimate statistical models from data in R have
built-in plotting capabilities. For example, the *survival* package
[@R-survival] has the `plot.survfit()`\index{R function!plot.survfit} function for plotting survival curves
created using event history analysis. These plots can be
knitted into presentation documents like the plots we have seen already.

However, sometimes either a package doesn't have built-in functions for
plotting model results the way you want to and/or you want to use
*ggplot2* to improve the aesthetic quality of the plots they do create
by default. In either case, you can almost always create the plot that
you want by first breaking into the model results object, extracting
what you want, then plotting it with *ggplot2*. The process is very
similar to what we did in Chapter \@ref(TablesChapter) to create custom tables.

To illustrate how this can work, let's create a caterpillar plot, like the following figure, showing the mean coefficient estimates and the
uncertainty surrounding them from a Bayesian normal linear regression
model using the *swiss* data frame. Here is our model:

```{r Ch10SwissModel, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Fit model
linear_brms_2 <- brm(Examination ~ Education +
                     Agriculture + Catholic + Infant.Mortality,
                     data = swiss,
                     family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
                     refresh = 0)
```

Remember from Chapter \@ref(TablesChapter) that we can create an object summarizing our estimation results like this:

```{r Ch10ModelSummaryResults, tidy=FALSE, dependson=-1}
# Create summary object
linear_brms_2_sum <- summary(linear_brms_2)

# Create summary data frame
linear_brms_2_sum_df <- data.frame(linear_brms_2_sum$fixed)

# Show data frame
linear_brms_2_sum_df
```

We want to use *ggplot2* to create credibility intervals for each
variable with **l.95..CI** as the minimum value and **u.95..CI** as the
maximum value. These are the lower and upper bounds of the middle 95
percent of the estimates' marginal posterior distributions, i.e. the 95
percent credibility intervals.[^chapter_10_25] We will also create a point at the **mean** of each estimate. To do this, we will use *ggplot2*'s
`geom_pointrange`\index{R function!geom\_pointrange} function.

First we need to do a little tidying up.

```{r Ch10SubsetBayes, tidy=FALSE}
# Convert row.names to column
linear_brms_2_sum_df$Variable <- row.names(linear_brms_2_sum_df)

# Keep only coefficient estimates
## This allows for a more interpretable scale
linear_brms_2_sum_df <- subset(linear_brms_2_sum_df,
                               Variable != "Intercept")
```

The first line of executable code creates a proper variable out of the
data frame's row.names attribute. In this case, `row.names` contains the
names of the variables included in the regression. The second
executable line removes the *Intercept* estimates. This
allows the variable's coefficient estimates to be plotted on a scale
that enables easier interpretation.

Now we can create our caterpillar plot (Figure \@ref(fig:Ch10CatPlot)).

```{r Ch10CatPlot, tidy=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap='Example Caterpiller Plot'}
library(dplyr)

# Rename variables to make them easier for ggplot2 to work with
linear_brms_2_sum_df <- rename(linear_brms_2_sum_df,
                               lower = `l.95..CI`)
linear_brms_2_sum_df <- rename(linear_brms_2_sum_df,
                               upper = `u.95..CI`)

# Make caterpillar plot
ggplot(data = linear_brms_2_sum_df,
       aes(x = reorder(Variable, lower),
           y = Estimate,
           ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
                        geom_pointrange(size = 1.4) +
                        geom_hline(yintercept = 0,
                                   linetype = "dotted") +
                        xlab("Variable") +
                        ylab("Coefficient Estimate") +
                        coord_flip() + theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

There are some new pieces of code in here, so let's take a look. First,
the data frame is reordered from the highest to lowest value of
**l.95..CI** using the `reorder()` function.\index{R function!reorder} We renamed this column "lower" so that it would be easier to work with in `ggplot()`.\index{R function!ggplot2} Reordering by these values makes the plot easier to
read. The middle point of the point range is set with `y` and the lower
and upper bounds with `ymin` and `ymax`. The `geom_hline()`\index{R function!geom\_hline} function used
here creates a dotted horizontal line at 0, i.e. no effect. `coord_flip()`\index{R function!cord\_flip}
flips the plot's coordinates so that the variable names are on the $y$-axis. We can include this plot in a knitted document the same way as
before.

Note that we create this example to help you understand the power of *ggplot2* to create new graphics from complex objects. This particular task---creating caterpillar plots from *brms* objects---has been packaged into the `stanplot()`\index{R function!stanplot} function that comes with *brms*.

\index{ggplot2|)}\index{R function!ggplot|)}

## JavaScript Graphs with *googleVis*

Markus Gesmann and Diego de Castillo's [-@R-googleVis] *googleVis* package
 allows us to use Google's Visualization API from within
R to create interactive tables, plots, and maps with Google Chart Tools.
Because the visualizations are written in JavaScript, they can be
included in HTML presentation documents created by R Markdown.
Unfortunately, they cannot be directly[^chapter_10_26] included in LaTeX-produced
PDFs. The *animation* package [@R-animation] does have some limited
features for including interactive visualizations in PDFs (as well as
HTML documents) and is worth investigating if you want to do this. The *gganimate* package allows you to annimate *ggplot2* graphics as GIFs.\index{GIF} However, these cannot be included in PDFs.

### Basic googleVis figures

Let's briefly look at how to make one type of figure with *googleVis*: a
choropleth map. This is created with the `gvisGeoChart()`\index{R function!gvisGeoChart} function. We
will use this example to illustrate how to incorporate *googleVis*
figures into R Markdown.[^chapter_10_27]

Imagine that we want to map global fertilizer consumption in 2011 using
the World Bank data we gathered in Chapter \@ref(DataGather). Remember that the data was highly right skewed,
so we will actually map the natural logarithm of the
**fert_cons** variable.[^chapter_10_28] Assuming that we have already
loaded the *main-data* data set, here is the code:

```{r Ch10GeoMap, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
# Load googleVis
library(googleVis)

# Subset main_data so that it only includes 2011
data_sub <- subset(main_data, year == 2011)

# Keep values of fert_cons greater-than 0.1 data_sub <-
subset(data_sub, fert_cons > 0.1)

# Find the natural logarithm of fert_cons
## Round the results to one decimal digit.
data_sub$fert_cons_log <- round(log(data_sub$fert_cons),
                                digits = 1)

# Make a map of Fertilizer Consumption
fc_map <- gvisGeoChart(data = data_sub,
                       locationvar = "iso2c",
                       colorvar = "LogConsumption",
                       options = list(
                            colors = "['#ECE7F2', '#A6BDDB',
                                       '#2B8CBE']",
                            width = "780px", height = "500px")
)
```

The `locationvar` argument specifies the variable with information on
each observation's location. Google Chart Tools can use ISO two-letter
country codes to determine each country's location. `colorvar` specifies
the variable with the values to map for each country. We can determine
other options by creating a list-type object with arguments specifying
characteristics such as the map's width, height, and colors. The colors
here are written using hexadecimal values. This is a commonly used
format for specifying colors on websites.[^chapter_10_29]

To view the figure on your computer, use *googleVis*'s `plot()`
function. For example, to view our map, type:

```{r Ch10ViewGoogleVisMapPlot, eval=FALSE}
plot(fc_map)
```

Note that you need to be connected to the internet to view figures
created by *googleVis*; otherwise, your image will not be able to access
the required JavaScript files from the Google Visualization API.

\begin{figure}
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/chapter_10/GeoChartScreenShot.png}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Screenshot of a \emph{googleVis} Geo Chart}
        \label{GeoMapImage}
\end{figure}

### Including *googleVis* in knitted documents

Typing `print(fc_map, tag = "chart")`\index{R function!print} in a knittable document would print
the entire JavaScript code needed to create the map. Much like we saw
with tables produced with *xtable* and *texreg* in Chapter \@ref(TablesChapter), we need to change the code chunk `results`
option to include the map as a map rather than as JavaScript markup. To
have the visualization show up in your HTML output, rather than the code
block, set the code chunk option to `results='asis'`.[^chapter_10_30] For
example, the full code needed to create and print *fc_map* is available
at: <https://bit.ly/2CfXWOs>.[^chapter_10_31] To knit the map into an R Markdown
document, type:

````r
`r ''````{r}, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
 # Create and print geo map
devtools::source_url("https://bit.ly/2CfXWOs")
```
````

### JavaScript Graphs with *htmlwidgets*-based packages

The number of tools for creating JavaScript graphs from R that can be
knitted into HTML files is growing rapidly. The *htmlwidgets*
[@R-htmlwidgets] framework is especially making the development of these
tools easier. There are tools built on *htmlwidgets*
for creating maps, network graphs, time series graphs, and interactive
tables, among others. Though the syntax of each of these tools differs,
they can all easily be included into R Markdown documents. Often you run their core functions in a code chunk, without needing to use
an additional call to `print` or `plot`.

### Chapter summary {-}

In this chapter we have learned how to take results from our statistical
analyses and other information from our data and dynamically present
them in figures. In the next chapters, we will learn the details of
how to create the LaTeX and Markdown presentation documents we use to
present the tables we created in Chapter \@ref(TablesChapter) and the figures we created in this chapter.

[^chapter_10_1]: There are, of course, a number of exceptions to this rule of
    thumb. @vanbelle2008 [Ch. 9] argues that a few
    numbers should be listed in a sentence, many numbers shown in
    tables, and relationships between numbers are best shown with
    graphs. Similarly, @tufte2001 argues that tables tend to
    outperform graphics for displaying 20 or fewer numbers. Graphics
    often outperform tables for showing larger data sets and
    relationships within the data.

[^chapter_10_2]: PDF: Portable Document Format, PNG: Portable Network Graphic,
    JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group.\
    A quick note about file formats: By default, *knitr* creates PDF-formatted
    figure files when knitting R LaTeX documents. These
    figures, generally built with vector graphics, allow you to zoom in
    on them by any amount without them becoming pixelated. This means
    that your images will be crisp in PDF presentation documents. For
    Markdown documents, *knitr* creates PNG images. PNG images are
    usually relatively high quality and can be rendered directly on
    websites, unlike PDFs. JPEG formatted files usually take up less
    disk space than PDF and PNG files. However, their quality is also
    worse and can often look very pixelated. For more information,
    Wikipedia has a comprehensive comparison of graphics file formats
    at:
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_graphics_file_formats>.

[^chapter_10_3]: The image used here is from @meyer2006.

[^chapter_10_4]: Note there are a number of other ways to set the size of a figure
    relative to a page element. See the LaTeX Wiki Book for more details:
    <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Page_Layout>.

[^chapter_10_5]: For simplicity, this code does not include the full image's actual
    file path.

[^chapter_10_6]: You can also include a title in quotation marks after the file
    path. This specifies the HTML `title` attribute. However, this
    attribute does not create a title for the image in the way that
    `caption` does for LaTeX float figures. Instead, it creates a
    tooltip, a small box that appears when you place your cursor over
    the image. Specifying descriptive alt text is very useful for screen
    readers that help visually impaired people access web content.

[^chapter_10_7]: Use the URL for the raw version of the
    file for images stored on GitHub.

[^chapter_10_8]: A pixel is the smallest discrete part of images displayed on a
    screen. See the "pixel" Wikipedia page for more details:
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel>.

[^chapter_10_9]: If a code chunk creates more than one figure, *knitr*
    automatically saves each into its own file in the same directory.

[^chapter_10_10]: File names are based on the code chunk label where they were
    created.

[^chapter_10_11]: In this chapter we will set this option in the markup rather
    than the code chunk. I prefer doing this because *knitr* options
    need to be on the same line and so they can sometimes result in very long
    lists of options that are difficult to read.

[^chapter_10_12]: <http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/>

[^chapter_10_13]: <http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/>

[^chapter_10_14]: Note that I did not specify the center environment. This is
    because it is specified in a *knitr* global chunk option.

[^chapter_10_15]: The full version of the URL is:
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christophergandrud/rep-res-book-v3-examples/master/data/main-data.csv>

[^chapter_10_16]: See:
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Examples/master/Graphs/ScatterPlotMatrix.R>.

[^chapter_10_17]: "GG" stands for grammar of graphics and "2" indicates that it is
    the second major version of the package.

[^chapter_10_18]: It is possible to combine a series of figures created with
    *ggplot2* into an animation. For a nice example of an animation
    using *ggplot2*, see Jerzy Wieczorek's animation of 2012 US
    presidential campaigning: <http://bit.ly/UUVKka>.

[^chapter_10_19]: <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/>

[^chapter_10_20]: <http://wiki.stdout.org/rcookbook/Graphs/>

[^chapter_10_21]: Note that everything we do here with *ggplot2* can also be done
    with R's default graphics, though the appearance will be different.

[^chapter_10_22]: This data is from @gandrudgrafstrom2012. The example here
    partially recreates Figure 1 from that paper.

[^chapter_10_23]: Remember from Chapter \@ref(GettingStartedRKnitr) that functions must be followed by parentheses. These layers are functions so they need to be followed
    by parentheses.

[^chapter_10_24]: The full URL is:
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Examples/master/Graphs/InflationLineGraph.R>.

[^chapter_10_25]: The procedures used here are also generally applicable for
    graphing frequentist confidence intervals once you have calculated
    the confidence intervals. One useful function for doing this is
    `confint`.

[^chapter_10_26]: The example in this chapter is from a screenshot.

[^chapter_10_27]: For demonstrations of the full range of plotting functions
    available, visit the *googleVis* website:
    <http://code.google.com/p/google-motion-charts-with-r/wiki/GadgetExamples#googleVis_Examples>.

[^chapter_10_28]: You'll notice in the code below that we remove all values of
    **fert_cons** less than 0.1. This is so that we can
    calculate integer values with the natural logarithm.

[^chapter_10_29]: You can also use hexadecimal values in *ggplot2*. The Color
    Brewer 2 website (<http://colorbrewer2.org/>) is very helpful for
    picking hexadecimal color palettes, among others.

[^chapter_10_30]: You can use `results=’asis’` to include almost any type of
    JavaScript graphics. For an example using the D3 JavaScript library
    and *knitr* see this page by Yihui Xie:
    <http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/javascript/>.

[^chapter_10_31]: The full URL is:
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Examples/master/Graphs/GoogleVisMap.R>.

[^chapter_10_32]: You can use the `gvisMotionChart()` function to make these.

[^chapter_10_33]: This is because motion charts and annotated time line charts rely
    on Flash, unlike the other Google visualizations. For more
    information see Markus Gesmann's blog post at:
    <http://www.magesblog.com/2012/05/interactive-reports-in-r-with-knitr-and.html>.
